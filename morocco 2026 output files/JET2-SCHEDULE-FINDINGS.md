## 🚨 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: SATURDAY RETURN NOT AVAILABLE

**Your Requirement:** Return Saturday April 11  
**Jet2 Reality:** Only flies Thursday/Sunday (NOT Saturday)

---

## 💡 OPTIONS TO CONSIDER

### **OPTION A: Adjust Return Date (Use Jet2)**

**A1: Return Thursday April 10 (1 day earlier)**
```
Impact:
- Lose 1 night in Agadir/Morocco
- Trip becomes 10 nights instead of 11
- Save £40-60 (avoid Saturday premium with other airlines)
- Get Jet2 benefits (bags included, better service)

Costs:
- Lose 1 hotel night (but save ~£80-100)
- Lose 1 day of trip
- Jet2 flight likely cheaper than Saturday alternative

Net: Probably saves money but cuts trip short
```

**A2: Return Sunday April 13 (2 days later)**
```
Impact:
- Add 2 extra nights in Morocco
- Trip becomes 13 nights instead of 11
- Need 2 extra hotel nights (~£160-200)
- Extra car hire days (~£80)
- May conflict with work/commitments

Costs:
- 2 extra nights accommodation: £160-200
- 2 extra days car hire: £80
- Total extra: £240-280

Net: Extends trip but adds significant cost
```

### **OPTION B: Mixed Airlines (Recommended)**

**Jet2 Outbound + easyJet/Ryanair Return**

**Structure:**
```
OUTBOUND (March 31):
Airline: Jet2
Route: Manchester → Marrakech
Day: Monday ✅ Available
Bags: INCLUDED (22kg × 2)
Cost: £70-90 per person = £140-180 total

RETURN (April 11):
Airline: easyJet or Ryanair
Route: Agadir → Manchester
Day: Saturday ✅ Available
Bags: Add separately
Cost: £80-90 per person + £60 bags = £220-240 total

TOTAL: £360-420
```

**Pros:**
- Keep your exact dates (March 31 - April 11)
- Get Jet2 benefits outbound (bags included, better service)
- Use easyJet/Ryanair for return (widely available)
- Saves vs full easyJet (£360-420 vs £390-440)

**Cons:**
- Two different airlines (different policies)
- Need to add bags separately for return
- Less consistency in experience

---

### **OPTION C: easyJet Both Ways (Simplest)**

**Structure:**
```
OUTBOUND (March 31):
easyJet Manchester → Marrakech
Day: Monday ✅ Definitely available (daily service)
Cost: £60-70 per person + £30 bags = £180-200 total

RETURN (April 11):
easyJet Agadir → Manchester
Day: Saturday ✅ Definitely available
Cost: £75-90 per person + £30 bags = £210-240 total

TOTAL: £390-440
```

**Pros:**
- Single airline (consistent policy)
- Both dates definitely available
- Daily flights (schedule flexibility)
- Known quantity

**Cons:**
- No bags included (£120 total for bags)
- More expensive than mixed option
- Lower service rating than Jet2

---

### **OPTION D: Check Alternative Saturday Dates**

**If you have flexibility:**

Check if Jet2 operates on different Saturdays:
- Saturday April 4? (1 week earlier return)
- Saturday April 18? (1 week later return)

**Benefit:** Might find a Saturday Jet2 operates both routes  
**Risk:** Unlikely - Jet2 operates Thu/Sun pattern consistently
