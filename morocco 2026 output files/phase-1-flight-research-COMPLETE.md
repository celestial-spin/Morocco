- Check: easyJet, Ryanair, Jet2
- Compare on: Skyscanner, Momondo, Google Flights, Direct airline sites

**Return:**

- **BUT:** You're 7 weeks out = optimal booking window = **BOOK NOW recommended**

**3. Compare Total Costs:**

Base fare + Bags + Parking + Drive time value

Don't just compare base fares!
```

**4. Check Baggage Policies:**
- easyJet: Bags cheaper if added at booking time
- Ryanair: Basic fare = cabin bag only, check bags expensive
- Jet2: Often includes 1 bag, verify

**5. Verify Dates:**
- Outbound: Monday March 31 (good day)
- Return: Saturday April 11 (expensive day but required)
- Consider: Could you return Friday April 10? (Might save £40-60 total)

---

### 📊 DECISION FRAMEWORK

**Choose easyJet if:**

### ⚠️ CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS

**1. Book Within 48 Hours:**

**2. Baggage Strategy:**
- 11 nights = Need checked bags
- Book bags AT SAME TIME as flights (cheaper)

**3. Parking:**
- Manchester airport parking: Book in advance
- On-site: £70-90 for 11 days
- Off-site: £40-60 for 11 days
- Pre-book for better rates

**4. Arrival Time Critical:**
- Afternoon arrival preferred (14:00-18:00)
- Allows riad check-in without stress
- Evening arrival requires late check-in arrangement

**5. Return Flight Flexibility:**
- Check if Friday April 10 return saves money

---

### 🔍 ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS

**Scenario A: Birmingham Instead of Manchester**
```
Pros:
- 35 miles closer (50 vs 85 miles)
- Smaller, easier airport

Cons:
- Only 5 flights/week vs 18

- Typically same price as Manchester
- Higher parking costs (£60 vs £50)

Verdict: Manchester better unless Birmingham £40+ cheaper per person
```

```
Pros:
- Saturday departures sometimes cheaper (conflicting data)
- More relaxed start to trip

Cons:
- Need 2 extra Marrakech nights (£200-300)
- Takes 2 vacation days from work

Verdict: Only worth if flight saves £150+ total
         (Unlikely - would need to check)
```

**Scenario C: Return via Marrakech Instead of Agadir**
```
Pros:
- More flight options
- Potentially cheaper

Cons:
- 3.5 hour drive Agadir → Marrakech on April 11
