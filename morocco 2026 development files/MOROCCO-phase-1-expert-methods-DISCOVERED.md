## 📅 GOLDILOCKS WINDOW - THE CRITICAL DISCOVERY

**Definition:** The timeframe when fares are most likely to be at their lowest - not too early (premium prices), not too late (desperation pricing), just right.

**For Your Morocco Trip (International, Spring):**

### **Standard Goldilocks Window:**
- **International off-peak:** 2-8 months before departure
- **International peak (spring/summer):** 3.5-9 months before departure

### **Your Specific Dates (March 31 departure):**
- **Today is February 13, 2026**
- **Departure in:** ~6.5 weeks (1.5 months)
- **Status:** ⚠️ **OUTSIDE Goldilocks Window** - you're at the late edge

**Expert Advice from Sources:**
- National Geographic/Going: "Outside of those windows, if you're getting to the edge, it's in your best interest to go ahead and book because at that point, it's not likely that you're going to see that flight price drop."
- Points Guy: "Start booking at the end of January or early February for spring break"
- Going: "Prices typically rise significantly three weeks before departure"

**Conclusion for Your Trip:** **BOOK SOON** - you're already at the late edge of the window. Prices likely to rise, not fall, from here.

---

## 🎯 BOOKING WINDOW BEST PRACTICES

### **When to Book by Trip Type:**

**Domestic Flights:**
- Off-peak: 1-3 months ahead
- Peak season (summer, holidays): 3-5 months ahead
- Sweet spot: 43 days before departure average

**International Flights:**
- Off-peak: 2-8 months ahead
- Peak season: 4-10 months ahead
- Spring break specifically: Book end of January to mid-February

### **The "21-Day Rule"**
**Critical Discovery:** Most airline advance purchase requirements kick in 21 days before departure. On Day 20, cheapest fares disappear and prices jump $100-200+.

**For Your Trip:** March 31 departure = 21-day deadline is **March 10**. You have ~3.5 weeks before this cliff.

### **Why Goldilocks Window Works:**

**Too Early (6-12 months out):**
- Airlines charge premium for advance planning convenience
- Fares often higher when seats first released
- Airlines know customers booking this early have fixed plans

**Just Right (Goldilocks Window):**
- Airlines actively managing inventory
- Competitive pricing to fill seats
- Best balance of availability and price

**Too Late (Last 3 weeks):**
- Business travelers booking (price insensitive)
- Limited seat availability
- Desperation pricing by airlines
- Prices spike significantly

## 💡 SEARCH STRATEGIES DISCOVERED

### **1. Flexible Date Searching**
**Tools:** Google Flights calendar view, Skyscanner "Whole Month" view
**Benefit:** See price differences across days - shifting by 1-2 days can save hundreds
**Your Case:** You have date flexibility (Sat 29 - Tue April 1 outbound, Sat 11 - Sun 13 return)

### **2. Multi-Airport Searching**
**Strategy:** Check all viable departure/arrival airports
**Your Case:** Manchester is primary, but could check Birmingham if significantly cheaper

### **3. Open-Jaw Booking**
**What it is:** Fly into one city, out of another
**Your Case:** Manchester → Marrakech, Agadir → Manchester (already doing this!)
**Price Impact:** Usually 30-40% premium vs round-trip, but saves 3.5h driving

### **4. Price Tracking & Alerts**
**Tools:** Google Flights alerts, Skyscanner price alerts, Going membership
**Strategy:** Set alerts but DON'T WAIT at this late stage - prices more likely to rise
**Your Case:** Given you're outside Goldilocks Window, track but book quickly if reasonable

### **5. One-Way vs Round-Trip**
**Strategy:** Sometimes cheaper to book two one-way tickets on different airlines
**Your Case:** Could book Jet2 return (priority) + different airline outbound if cheaper

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES DISCOVERED

### **Mistake 1: Comparing Base Fares Instead of True Total Cost**
**The Problem:** Budget airlines show low base fare but charge heavily for bags, seats, priority
**Example from research:** 
- Budget airline: £49 base + £80 bags + £24 priority = £153 total
- Full-service: £86 base with bags included = £86 total
- Budget airline actually £67 MORE expensive!

**Lesson:** NEVER compare base fares - always calculate true total with ALL required add-ons

### **Mistake 2: Not Reading Baggage Policies**
**The Problem:** Assuming baggage is included or underestimating fees
**Stats:** U.S. airlines earned $5.3 billion from baggage fees in 2021
**Solution:** Check EACH airline's baggage policy before comparison

### **Mistake 3: Booking Too Late**
**The Problem:** Waiting for "last-minute deals" that rarely exist anymore
**Reality:** Last-minute deals are largely myth - prices rise in final 3 weeks
**Your Situation:** Already at late edge - don't wait for deals

### **Mistake 4: Pre-Paying Baggage at Airport**
**The Problem:** Airport baggage fees up to 50% higher than online pre-payment
**Solution:** ALWAYS pre-pay baggage online during booking

### **Mistake 5: Not Checking True Cost**
**Hidden fees that inflate prices 20-40%:**
- Checked baggage (£25-50 per bag per flight)
- Cabin bags (£10-25 on budget airlines)
- Seat selection (£10-30 per person per flight)
- Priority boarding (£6-12 per person per flight)
- Card payment fees (1-3%)
- Airport check-in fees (£25-55 if not checked in online)

### **Mistake 6: Assuming All Search Engines Show Same Prices**
**Reality:** Different engines show different prices
**Frommers testing:** Momondo found best prices on 50% of test routes
**Strategy:** Use multiple tools - Google Flights + Skyscanner minimum

### **Mistake 7: Booking Too Early**
**The Problem:** Booking 6-12 months out locks in premium pricing
**Morocco relevance:** Less relevant - you're at opposite extreme (too late not too early)

## 💰 BAGGAGE FEES - CRITICAL FINDINGS

### **Why Baggage Fees Matter:**
- Can add 20-100% to base fare
- Pre-pay online: 50% cheaper than airport
- Different policies by airline create comparison complexity

### **Typical Baggage Fee Ranges:**
**Budget Airlines (Ryanair, easyJet):**
- Checked bag: £25-50 per bag per flight
- Cabin bag (overhead): £10-25 per flight
- Priority boarding: £6-12 (required for cabin bags)
- Total for 2 people round-trip with bags: £80-200+

**Full-Service (Jet2, TUI):**
- Checked bag: Usually included (22kg)
- Cabin bag: Usually included (10kg)
- Priority: Optional
- Total baggage cost: £0 (included in base fare)

### **Your Priority:**
"Need full baggage allowance - more important on return (buying in Morocco)"

**This makes Jet2 CRITICAL for return flight:**
- Includes 22kg checked + 10kg cabin per person
- No add-on fees
- Return flight MORE important than outbound (confirmed)
