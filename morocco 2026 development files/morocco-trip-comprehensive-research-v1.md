## 🚗 CAR HIRE - Marrakech to Agadir (One-Way)

### **⚠️ CRITICAL DECISION: WHEN TO PICK UP CAR**

**YOU DON'T NEED A CAR IN MARRAKECH!**

Since you're spending 2 nights in Marrakech (March 31 - April 2), you have two options:

**OPTION A: Airport Pick-up on Arrival (March 31)**
- Duration: 11 days (March 31 - April 11)
- Cost: ~£570 (11 days @ £25/day + fees)
- Downside: Car sits unused for 2 days, wasted £50-70
- Downside: Navigate Marrakech traffic immediately after flight

**OPTION B: Riad/Hotel Delivery Morning of Day 3 (April 2) ✅ RECOMMENDED**
- Duration: 9 days (April 2 - April 11)
- Cost: ~£500 (9 days @ £25/day + fees)
- **SAVINGS: £50-70**
- Advantage: Fresh, rested driver
- Advantage: Skip Marrakech traffic chaos
- Advantage: Company delivers TO your door (free service from local companies)
- Advantage: Start journey directly from riad

**DECISION REQUIRED:** Choose Option A or B based on your riad location accessibility

### **Key Requirements:**
- Pick-up: **EITHER** Marrakech Airport (March 31) **OR** Your Riad/Hotel (April 2 morning)
- Drop-off: Agadir Airport (April 11)
- Duration: **EITHER** 11 days **OR** 9 days
- Type: Standard sedan (no 4x4 needed)
- Insurance: COMPREHENSIVE (non-negotiable)

### **Pricing Research:**

**General Morocco Car Hire:**
- Base rate: £9-40/day depending on company/category
- Economy cars: £9-20/day
- Compact/Standard: £20-40/day
- **One-way fee Marrakech→Agadir: £60-100** (major cost factor)

### **One-Way Fee Analysis:**

From TripAdvisor forum data:
- Local company quoted: €180 for 3 days including €60 one-way fee
- Breakdown: €40/day + €60 driver return = €180 total
- Equivalent: **~£15/day + £50 one-way fee**

**Key Insight:** One-way Marrakech→Agadir incurs significant fee because:
- Company must send driver to collect car in Agadir
- Driver return bus fare + accommodation + fuel
- Alternative routes (via Casablanca) may avoid fee but add distance

### **Estimated Total Car Hire Cost:**

| Component | Low | Mid | High |
|-----------|-----|-----|------|
| Base rental (**9 days if riad delivery**) | £135 | £225 | £315 |
| Base rental (**11 days if airport pickup**) | £165 | £275 | £385 |
| One-way drop fee | £50 | £75 | £100 |
| Comprehensive insurance | £80 | £120 | £150 |
| Fuel (estimated 1,000km) | £80 | £100 | £120 |
| **TOTAL (Riad Delivery - 9 days)** | **£345** | **£520** | **£685** |
| **TOTAL (Airport Pickup - 11 days)** | **£375** | **£570** | **£755** |
| **POTENTIAL SAVINGS (Riad Delivery)** | **£30** | **£50** | **£70** |

**Target:** £450-550 total (per travel profile) - **Achievable with riad delivery option**

### **Riad/Hotel Delivery Service:**

**LOCAL COMPANIES WITH FREE DELIVERY:**
- **Saad Rent Cars** - Free delivery across Marrakech (Medina, Gueliz, riads)
- **Abid Cars** - Verified reviews: "Staff came to the medina where our Riad was"
- **Medloc Maroc** - "Delivered on time right into old town Marrakesh"

**INTERNATIONAL BRANDS:**
- **Hertz Marrakech** - Hotel/riad delivery available
- **Europcar** - Delivery service (may charge fee)

**How It Works:**
1. Book rental for April 2-11 (9 days)
2. Specify riad/hotel address for morning delivery (7-9am)
3. Company delivers car to your door
4. Sign paperwork, inspect vehicle, drive away
5. Return at Agadir Airport April 11

**IMPORTANT:** Some deep Medina riads are not car-accessible. Ask your riad if cars can reach them. If not, company can deliver to nearest accessible point (5-10 min walk) or you can collect from their office in Gueliz.

### **⚠️ COMPANIES TO AVOID (Based on Reviews):**
- **AddCar** at Marrakech Airport - Multiple scam reports (hidden fees, bait-and-switch)
- **Budget operators** without proper offices - Check reviews first

**Booking Strategy:**
- Book direct with major international brands (Hertz, Europcar, Sixt)
- OR use comparison sites (Rentalcars.com, Auto Europe)
- Confirm one-way fee in advance
- Verify insurance coverage (never skip this)

### **Driving Notes from Research:**
- Marrakech→Todra: ~330km (5.5hrs)
- Todra→Merzouga: ~160km (2.5hrs)  
- Merzouga→Agdz: ~280km (4.5hrs)
- Agdz→Taroudant: ~270km (4hrs)
- Taroudant→Agadir: ~85km (1.5hrs)
- **Total driving: ~1,125km over 11 days**
