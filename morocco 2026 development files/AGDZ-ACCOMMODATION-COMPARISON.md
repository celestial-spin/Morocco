## 🎯 DECISION FRAMEWORK

**CHOOSE DAR QAMAR IF:**
- You want a HEATED pool for April (recovery essential)
- Outstanding food is important
- You want wine with dinner (rare in Morocco)
- You like authentic, hidden locations
- Budget: £160-200 is acceptable

**CHOOSE KASBAH AZUL IF:**
- You want the BEST-rated property
- Food is the #1 priority (chef-owned)
- You can handle potentially cold pool
- You want maximum tranquility (isolated)
- Budget: £170-220 is acceptable

**CHOOSE DAR AMAZIR IF:**
- Budget is primary concern (save £40-80)
- Indoor pool is acceptable backup
- You prefer proximity to town
- You want simplest, most straightforward option

---

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION: **DAR QAMAR**

**REASONS:**
1. **Heated pool** = Critical for April 5th recovery day
2. **Excellent food** consistently praised
3. **Wine license** = Rare treat after desert
4. **Hammam on-site** = Perfect for Steph's relaxation
5. **Palm grove walks** = Nature immersion
6. **Within budget** = £160-200 target range

**The heated pool is the deciding factor.** After 4 days of driving (Marrakech → Todra → Merzouga → Agdz), you need a comfortable recovery day. An unheated pool in April could be unusable, defeating the primary purpose.

**TRADE-OFFS ACCEPTED:**
- Not #1 rated (but still excellent 8.4/10)
- Dinner may be pricier (but quality justifies it)
- Location harder to find (but adds to authenticity)
