## 📝 MAJOR DECISIONS MADE

### **2026-02-14: Changed Trip Duration (11 nights → 10 nights)**
**What:** Reduced trip from 11 nights to 10 nights, changed return date from April 10 to April 9  
**Why:** Return flight on April 9 was significantly cheaper and better timed (11:05 departure vs late evening)  
**Impact:** 
- Budget: Saved on accommodation (1 fewer night)
- Route: Needed to adjust Agadir duration from 3 nights to 2.5 nights (checkout April 9)
- Itinerary: All locations compressed by 1 day
**Alternatives Considered:** Keep 11 nights with April 10 return (rejected due to cost)

---

### **2026-02-14: Replaced Agdz with N'kob Stopover**
**What:** Changed route to stop in N'kob for 1 night instead of Agdz for 2 nights  
**Why:** 
- Agdz fully booked for Easter period (all 6 researched properties unavailable)
- Direct drive Merzouga → Taroudant (570km, 9-12h) too exhausting
- N'kob is perfect midpoint (280km from Merzouga, 280km to Taroudant)
- N'kob has unique 45+ traditional kasbahs, excellent food, pool available
**Impact:**
- Budget: Cost-neutral (£60-80 for 1 night vs £140-200 for 2 nights in Agdz = saves £80-120)
- Route: Two manageable 4-5h drives instead of one brutal 9-12h drive
- Experience: Gained unique village atmosphere, maintained pool recovery option
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Tazzarine (cheaper but less interesting)
- Push through direct to Taroudant (rejected as too exhausting)

---

### **2026-02-14: Extended Taghazout to 3 Nights (Reduced Taroudant to 2)**
**What:** Changed from Taroudant 3 nights + Taghazout 2 nights → Taroudant 2 nights + Taghazout 3 nights  
**Why:**
- Invested £357 specifically for Hyatt gym with Peloton bikes
- 2 nights = only 2 rushed gym sessions
- 3 nights = 3-4 relaxed sessions + 2 full beach recovery days
- Car dropoff April 6 (not April 7) = less stressful final days
- Taroudant is smaller "Little Marrakech" - 2 nights sufficient
**Impact:**
- Budget: £108-168 more (3rd Taghazout night vs Taroudant night), but better ROI on gym investment
- Route: Drop car April 6 instead of April 7 (saves 1 day rental)
- Experience: More time for gym focus, less rushed recovery
**Alternatives Considered:** Keep equal split (rejected - doesn't justify gym investment)

---

### **2026-02-14: Booked Hyatt Regency via Two Separate Bookings**
**What:** Created two separate bookings for Hyatt Regency Taghazout (Apr 6-7 + Apr 7-9)  
**Why:** Hotel wanted £55 extra to add third night to existing booking; booking separately via Trivago saved £55  
**Impact:**
- Budget: Saved £55 (£176 vs £231 for third night)
- Logistics: Two bookings = risk of room change
- Task created: Call hotel tomorrow to link bookings and request same room
**Alternatives Considered:** Pay £55 extra for direct add-on (rejected - unnecessary cost)
