## 🎯 PRIORITY RANKING (When Constraints Conflict)

**Priority Order:**

1. **DIRECT FLIGHTS** (non-negotiable)
2. **Jet2 on RETURN flight** (baggage critical)
3. **Dates within range** (prefer Mon/Tue out, avoid Sat/Sun out)
4. **Full baggage allowance** (especially return)
5. **Jet2 on outbound** (nice to have, not critical)
6. **Price** (important but not primary driver)

**Decision Framework:**
- If Jet2 return available: Strong preference even if costs more
- If Jet2 return unavailable: Must ensure full baggage on alternative
- Outbound: Can use different airline if dates/price better
- Weekend arrival Marrakech: Avoid if possible (busy) but not hard constraint

---

## 📋 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

**Marrakech Weekend Traffic:**
- Saturday/Sunday arrivals make city busier
- Prefer Monday/Tuesday arrival for better experience
- Not a hard constraint, just preference

**Open-Jaw Route:**
- Manchester → Marrakech (outbound)
- Agadir → Manchester (return)
- Expect 30-40% premium vs round-trip
- Worth it to avoid 3.5h backtrack drive

**Baggage Strategy:**
- Light on outbound
- Heavier on return (shopping in Morocco)
- Return flight baggage allowance MORE critical
