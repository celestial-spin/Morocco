We would appreciate your recommendation for your quietest and most comfortable room for a couple. We understand some rooms may have better soundproofing than others.

We are starting a road trip on the morning of April 2. We will have a rental car delivered to us that morning, so we need:

1. Confirmation of the exact name and location of your recommended parking area
2. Confirmation that a car rental company can deliver a vehicle to this parking location
3. Staff assistance to help us walk with our luggage from the riad to the parking point on the morning of April 2 (approximately 8:00-8:30am)
4. The cost per night for parking

**Questions:**
- What is your rate for these dates (March 31 - April 2)?
- Is breakfast included in the rate?
- What is your cancellation policy?
- Do you offer any direct booking discount compared to booking.com rates?

We have read excellent reviews about your riad, particularly praising your Bab Doukkala location, staff helpfulness, and the beautiful pool and terrace. We are looking forward to experiencing authentic Moroccan hospitality before beginning our journey.

Please let us know your availability and rates at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,

We will be collecting a rental car on the morning of April 2 to begin our road trip. We have read in reviews that you offer guest pickup from a nearby free parking area and that Abdul is very helpful with arrangements.

Could you please confirm:

1. The exact location of the free parking you recommend
2. Whether a car rental company can deliver a vehicle to this parking location on the morning of April 2 (around 8:30am)
3. Whether staff can help us with luggage from the riad to the parking on the morning of April 2

**Rate Inquiry:**
- What is your rate for March 31 - April 2, 2026?
- Is breakfast included?

- Do you offer a direct booking discount?

We have read wonderful reviews about your riad, particularly the larger-than-usual pool, beautiful modern design, and Abdul's exceptional hospitality. Your high rating (9.6/10) and convenient location near Bab Laksour are exactly what we are looking for.

We would appreciate a response at your earliest convenience so we can finalize our accommodation plans.

Kind regards,

Phil & Steph

## NOTES FOR SENDING:

**Before sending these emails:**

1. **Find contact emails:**
   - Riad BE: Check booking.com listing or website riadbe-marrakech.com
   - Les Yeux Bleus: Check booking.com listing

2. **Add your actual contact details:**
   - Your email address
   - UK phone number (optional but helpful for WhatsApp coordination)

3. **Timing:**
   - Send both emails same day
   - Follow up after 48 hours if no response
   - Book.com often has "Ask a Question" feature if direct email unavailable

4. **Response expectations:**
   - Good riads respond within 24-48 hours
   - They may ask for phone/WhatsApp for easier coordination
   - They should provide clear parking information

5. **What to look for in responses:**
   - Clear pricing breakdown
   - Parking location name/GPS coordinates
   - Confirmation they can help with car hire logistics
   - Friendly, professional tone (indicates good service)

**If they quote prices:**
- Compare both offers
- Consider: Riad BE location might be slightly better (Bab Doukkala vs Bab Laksour)
- Consider: Les Yeux Bleus has higher reviews + FREE parking
- Decide based on total value (price + location + parking cost)

**Booking strategy:**
- If prices within £20 of each other → Choose Riad BE (better location for car access)
- If Les Yeux Bleus £40+ cheaper → Consider it (free parking + higher reviews offset location)
- Book whichever you choose ASAP (early April is popular)
