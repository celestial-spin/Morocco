## 🔍 ACCOMMODATION RESEARCH STRATEGY

### **Recommended Approach:**

**Week 1 (Now):**
1. Research Agadir gym hotels (call to verify equipment)
2. Research Merzouga luxury camps (book if find good one)
3. Shortlist 2-3 options for each other location

**Week 2:**
1. Book Agadir (once gym verified)
2. Book Merzouga (if not already done)
3. Book Marrakech (late dinner availability confirmed)

**Week 3:**
1. Book remaining locations (Todra, Agdz, Taroudant)
2. Confirm all bookings
3. Create master booking spreadsheet

### **Search Tools:**
- **Booking.com** - Good for Morocco, filters for pools/gyms
- **TripAdvisor** - Reviews crucial for gym equipment verification
- **Airbnb** - Traditional riads sometimes here
- **Direct websites** - Luxury desert camps often book direct
- **Google Maps** - Verify location proximity to attractions

### **Verification Checklist (Agadir Gym Hotel):**
- [ ] Call hotel directly: "Do you have exercise bikes in the gym?"
- [ ] Ask about free weights/dumbbells availability
- [ ] Check gym opening hours (need morning access)
- [ ] Request photos of gym if possible
- [ ] Read TripAdvisor reviews mentioning gym
- [ ] Verify pool + spa/hammam available
- [ ] Confirm beachfront or walking distance
- [ ] Check parking availability

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED FROM FLIGHT RESEARCH

### **Key Insights for Future Planning:**

**1. Cookie/Price Increase "Scam" - MYTH:**
- Research confirmed: clearing cookies does NOT affect flight prices
- Price changes are due to dynamic pricing (real-time inventory)
- User experienced £50pp increase while browsing
- **Verdict:** Normal dynamic pricing, not manipulation

**2. Jet2 One-Way Flights:**
- Jet2 DOES offer one-way but adds hidden "supplement"
- User successfully booked open-jaw with Jet2 + Ryanair mix
- Google Flights multi-city search worked well
- **Learning:** Mix airlines for open-jaw = often cheaper than single airline

**3. Date Flexibility:**
- User initially wanted Monday-Thursday (10 nights)
- Actually booked Sunday-Thursday (11 nights)
- **Got the original 11-night trip back!**
- Flights booked at 6.5 weeks out (outside Goldilocks Window but acceptable)

**4. Todra Gorge Optimization:**
- Originally had 2 nights Todra in 11-night plan
- Cut to 1 night when trying to fit 10 nights
- Now restored to 2 nights (full experience)
- **Learning:** 2 nights allows proper exploration vs rushing
